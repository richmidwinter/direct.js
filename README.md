direct.js
=========

Javascript routing library.

A minimalist alternative to the AngularJS ngRoute module that deliberately lacks features, including AngularJS itself.

Works in recent versions of Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Route matching has a precendence and the last route is used when no match is found. Currently equires jQuery, but the dependency is minimal.
